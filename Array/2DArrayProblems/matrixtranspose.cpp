/*
Problem
Given a square matrix A & its number of rows (or columns) N, return the
transpose of A.
The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over it's main diagonal,
switching the row and column indices of the matrix.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000

Sample Input1
A = [
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]
]
N = 3

Time complexity : O(N2)

Space complexity : O(1), as no extra space for a new matrix was used
