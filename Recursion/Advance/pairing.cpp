/*
Friends Pairing Problem
There are n friends, we have to find all the pairings possible. Each person can be
paired with only one person or does not pair with anyone.
Idea: we have two options, iâ€™th friend does not get paired or we have n-1 options
to pair it with anyone.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
