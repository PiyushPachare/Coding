Implementation
1. Make a node named head. This will act as the start of the linked list.

Deletion of a node

delete it.

K reverse[IMP]
Given a linked list and an integer K. Reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time

Idea: There are 2 cases:

2. The size of the linked list is more than K. Reverse the first K nodes and
recurse for the remaining list.
